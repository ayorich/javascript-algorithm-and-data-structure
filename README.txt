This pattern involves creating a window 
which can either be an array or number from one position to another 
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created) 
very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

This sliding window pattern can be use to find the longest english word in a set of characters
eg. "hellothere"
